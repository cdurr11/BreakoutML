# BreakoutML
This project includes a working rendition of Atari Breakout, created using a Flask back-end and a React front-end.  
This project used Keras and TensorFlow to create infrastructure necessary to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning Model so that it can play against itself.
I am currently experimenting to find the hyperparameters and architecture that yield the best results.
